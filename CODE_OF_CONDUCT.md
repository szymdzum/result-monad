# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project and community a positive and professional experience
for everyone.

## Core Principles

- Be respectful to others
- Communicate constructively
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
- Accept constructive criticism
- Don't harass, troll, or belittle others

## The TL;DR Version

If you're looking for a simpler version of all the above: Just don't be a dick. That covers most of
it.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. In case of
unacceptable behavior, maintainers may take appropriate action including temporary or permanent bans
from project communication channels.

## Contact

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project
maintainers.
